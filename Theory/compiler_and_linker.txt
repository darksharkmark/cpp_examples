- compiler

code is just text we need to then compile the code and link it
compiler turns text into "object files"
preproccessor runs
abstract syntax tree
constant data or instructions
#include literally pastes the file in
anything constant at compile time will be done at compile time
theres no point in doing work at runtime if its constant

- linker

find each symbol and each function and link them up together
'static' means that the function or variable is only for that translation unit (that file)
